                                I’m a <span className="aboutme-important">Computer Engineering</span> graduate from the 
                                <span className="aboutme-important">University of Guelph</span> who loves turning complex 
                                problems into elegant, reliable solutions. My background blends full-stack software development, 
                                hardware design, networking, and systems analysis — giving me the versatility to work across the 
                                stack and bridge the gap between ideas and execution.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                
                                I’ve built secure enterprise architectures, developed automation tools that save teams hours of work, 
                                and delivered full-stack applications using Python, Java, JavaScript, React, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, 
                                AWS, and Microsoft Azure. I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams, learning from different perspectives, and 
                                finding innovative ways to make systems faster, safer, and more efficient.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                
                                Currently pursuing my P.Eng designation, I’m motivated by projects that combine technical challenge with real-world impact. 
                                Whether it’s streamlining workflows, improving reliability, or experimenting with emerging technologies, I’m always looking 
                                for ways to push my skills further — and have fun along the way.
