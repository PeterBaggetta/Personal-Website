                            <p>I am a software developer who enjoys full stack programming as well as foundational computer mechanisms. 
                            I completed my degree as a <span class="aboutme-important">Computer Engineer</span> from the 
                            <span class="aboutme-important">University of Guelph</span> and have gained an extensive 
                            amount of experience from projects and past jobs throughout that time. I hope to pursue my P.Eng. licence in a 
                            challenging environment where I can demonstrate my collaborative skills by working in teams, while also 
                            providing applicable design skills and programming knowledge to work towards innovative solutions and expand my knowledge!
